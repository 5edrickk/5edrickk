## Hi there 👋
# 5edrickk.com

Personal website and development portfolio.

This repository serves as a central place for my personal projects, technical studies, and experiments in software development. It reflects my learning process, design decisions, and practical experience across different technologies.

## Overview

The content of this repository includes:

- Personal and academic projects  
- Technical experiments and proof-of-concept implementations  
- Progressive exploration of software design and architecture  
- Continuous improvement through refactoring and iteration  

The goal is not only to deliver working solutions, but to understand the underlying concepts and trade-offs behind them.

## Technologies & Concepts

You may find work involving:

- **C / C++** (including SFML, game logic, and low-level concepts)
- **Java** (object-oriented programming, MVC, clean code practices)
- **Web development** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- **Version control** (Git, GitHub workflows)
- **Networking and security fundamentals** (in active study)

## Purpose

This repository is intended as a living portfolio.  
It documents progress, experimentation, and learning rather than presenting only polished or final products.

Code quality and structure improve over time as new concepts are applied and previous decisions are revisited.

## Project Status

Ongoing development.  
Some projects or features may be incomplete, reflecting active work or learning phases.
